        <p> Soon after starting their walk down the High Line, two visitors stopped at a delicate model of the earth atop a pedestal. “Insectageddon,” they paused, reading out the colorful word running down the sculpture next to a large, decorative bright pink and blue bug. “Insect,” then another pause, “insectageddon.” </p>

        <p>Bright orange and black bugs alongside fuzzy bumble bees and a pale green butterfly overtook the metal railings along the High Line that look out at skyscrapers, colorful murals and the Hudson River.</p>

        <p>Chelsea’s High Line was filled Saturday, September 25, with those planning to attend insectageddon or others who stumbled upon it. Workshops earlier this month and new signs explaining plants' relationship to insects have been featured on the High Line throughout September, culminating in this artistic and educational exhibition titled “Insectageddon.” 
        </p>

        <p>Scientists, poets, activists, artists and Anusha Vaish — an eleven-year-old passionate about insects — came together for the three hour event featuring speakers, tours, interactive poetry and film screenings with information and artistic activities for children available. 
        </p>

        <p>Chilean artist and poet Cecilia Vicuña's vision was central to the insect theme and why the High Line’s month-long programming focused on insects leading up to their annual horticulture celebration. In a video about the celebration, she explains how her intent is to showcase and celebrate insects, along with their relationship to humans and native plants.</p>

        <p>“Insectageddon celebrates the millions of insects that visit and make their home on the highline every year,” Vicuña said. “Join us in a collective act of love and awareness to celebrate insects and pollinators.” 
        </p>

        <p>Vicuña also talks about the loss of insects around the world due to the scale of industrial farming, pesticides and habitat destruction. 
        </p>

        <p>A review in Biological Conservation from 2019, estimated that the weight of all insects on Earth is dropping by 2.5% every year. In addition, up to 40% of all insect species will be endangered in the next decades and around 41% have seen a decline in population in the past ten years. 
        </p>

        <p>The High Line is home to a variety of both native and non-native insect species — from the milkweed bug to the spicebush swallowtail butterfly — and High Line gardeners work to ensure that insect species are supported along with their larger ecosystem. This includes small “bee hotels” shelters for local bees, integrated pest management that focuses on insect and plant relationships, promoting biodiversity and creating insect-friendly water sources.  
        </p>

        <p>“I hope you’re wondering how you can save the insects,” said sixth-grade entomologist Anusha Vaish, who was the first speaker of the afternoon and an advisor for the event. 
        </p>

        <p>Speaking in an amphitheater on the High Line overlooking 10th Avenue, Vaish implored the crowd of over 50 to re-examine their relationship with insects and give advice for ways they can help the environment.
